## PROBLEMS
> Civic organizations provide humanitarian assistance to individuals, groups, other organizations, and institutions that are less fortunate and in need. They address certain concerns that the government is unable to answer. Unfortunately, because of the pandemic affecting us and the restrictions placed because of it, civic organizations and other like minded groups are now limited in their interactions with their beneficiaries and thus are unable to connect with the people who are a little fortunate but they also need these basic necessities for their survival in this pandemic situation.

## SOLUTIONS
- Team Avlamb came up with the mutual platform for the volunteers and people especially senior citizens who are restrained from going outside due to the present circumstances.
- Further the project also provides the opportunity for the vendors to expand their business and provide employment.
- The project also helps affected people to connect with plasma donors in their hour of need. 
- Moreover, the application also guides users to be precautious during the pandemic period by providing tips and hacks in it's own unique way.
-  It also bears the anti-depression feature to overcome their stress/ frustration/ depression/ anxiety. The decentralized feature of the application makes it different from other platforms. 
- We've tried to keep the project simple and user-friendly by using various animations and self-designed vector-images. 

## INSPIRATION
> We were inspired by the idea of converting crisis into opportunity by our honorable Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi. Further the volunteer's and NGO's who showed great enthusiasm trying to help people in the pandemic inspired us to create a mutual platform for the volunteers and the needy. Moreover, despite the challenges Covid-19 has created, the outbreak has quickly broadened the space for innovation and collaboration within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Pushing us to recognise just how much we can achieve in a very short amount of time. It has driven a creative solution-focused and collaborative mindset in us!!
